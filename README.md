# GameDB Web Application
<!-- Welcome to the GameDB Web Application GitHub repository! This is an ongoing project aimed at providing gamers with a powerful tool to track the games they play, own, and want. As an enthusiast of MongoDB, NestJS, and Angular, you'll find this repository a perfect fit for your development needs.

## Features (Work in Progress)
While the project is still under development, here are some exciting features that i want to build:

Game Tracking: Users will be able to keep a comprehensive record of the games they have played, including details such as title, genre, platform, release date, and progress status. This feature will allow users to monitor their gaming achievements and maintain a sense of accomplishment.

Game Library Management: The application will offer users the ability to create and manage a personalized game library. Users can add their owned games, including information such as physical or digital copies, purchase date, and rating. This feature will help users keep their game collection organized and easily accessible.

Wishlist Management: Users can create a wishlist of games they desire to play in the future. They will be able to add games, specify priority levels, and even add notes or reviews about their desired titles. This feature will allow users to keep track of their gaming goals and plan their future gaming experiences.

User Authentication and Authorization: Implementing user authentication and authorization features will ensure secure access to the application. Users will have their personalized accounts and the ability to manage their game-related data securely.

Interactive User Interface: The application's user interface will be built using Angular, providing a seamless and intuitive experience. The responsive design will ensure optimal usability across different devices and screen sizes.

## Technology Stack
The GameDB Web Application utilizes a powerful stack of technologies:

Front-end: Angular
Back-end: NestJS (Node.js)
